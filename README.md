Rolling Battle is a 2D physics-based platformer featuring a unique enemy-to-ally conversion mechanic. As the player, the goal is to stay on the platform while avoiding being pushed off by rolling enemies. Players can convert the nearest enemy into an ally, reversing its movement direction to counteract the incoming threat. Strategic use of converted allies allows the player to push other enemies off the platform while maintaining balance. The game challenges players to manage momentum, react to enemy waves, and make tactical decisions to survive. The game ends if the player is knocked off the platform, but if they successfully push 10 enemies off, they win.
