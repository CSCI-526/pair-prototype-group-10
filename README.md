## Logline

In this fast-paced 2D physics-based platformer, survival hinges on strategy—dodge rolling enemies that threaten to push you off the edge, but flip the battle by converting them into allies, reversing their momentum, and using their combined force to push the remaining threats off the platform before they knock you out.

## Genre Research

### Researched Titles:
- **Heave Ho**
- **Badland**
- **Tumbleseed**

### Common Tropes:
- Momentum-based movement requiring precise control due to physics forces.
- Gravity and collision mechanics influencing interactions.
- Knockback effects and environmental hazards increasing difficulty.
- Emphasis on survival and adapting to dynamic environments over precise platforming.
- Use of physics-based interactions to create emergent gameplay challenges.

These elements directly tie into the game's core mechanic—converting enemies into allies to manipulate battlefield momentum and turn the tide in the player's favor.

## Twist: Enemy-to-Ally Conversion

Unlike traditional 2D physics-based platformers where enemies are always obstacles, **Rolling Battle** introduces a unique enemy conversion mechanic. Players can select the nearest rolling enemy and convert it into an ally, reversing its direction. This introduces a **strategic element**, requiring players to:
- Time conversions effectively to maximize impact.
- Use allies to counter enemy momentum.
- Plan their positioning to maintain battlefield control.

### Why This is Innovative for a 2D Platformer:
- Shifts gameplay from pure survival to **strategic physics manipulation**.
- Encourages tactical thinking over simple reaction-based gameplay.
- Integrates **momentum, mass, and force** as core mechanics for decision-making.
- Allows for **emergent gameplay**, where player choices actively shape outcomes.

## Prototype Description

**Rolling Battle** is a 2D physics-based platformer with a unique enemy-to-ally conversion mechanic. The player's objective is to stay on the platform while avoiding being knocked off by rolling enemies. By converting the nearest enemy into an ally, players can reverse its movement and push back against threats.

### Gameplay Objectives:
- **Survive** as long as possible by avoiding being pushed off.
- **Convert** enemies into allies strategically to counteract threats.
- **Win** by successfully pushing 10 enemies off the platform.
